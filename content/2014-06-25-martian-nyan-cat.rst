Today I participated in the `Hack Day`_ at the 
`UK National Astronomy Meeting`_ in Portsmouth.
Apart from working on a few silly side projects,
my colleagues `Jeremy Harwood`_, `Leigh Smith`_, and I
decided to produce a video which might well change the face
of astronomy outreach and visualisation forever.

The video below demonstrates how astronomers may be able
to use `Nyan Cat`_,
a popular figure beloved by younger generations across the world, 
as a novel tool for astronomy outreach and education:

In the video, our rainbow-tailed friend can be seen to fly
across the surface of Mars. The background images shown are actual 
observations obtained by the HRSC camera on board the
European Space Agency's `Mars Express`_ spacecraft.

The data was obtained from ESA's `Planetary Science Archive`_.
At the frame rate shown, 
our feline friend would take nearly 2 days to fly across all the 
observations.
We hope to produce such a full-length video
in the near future.
We believe that a video containing ALL the data,
with or without an airborne mammal on top,
can serve as a genuinely useful visualisation
to give people a feel for the wealth and nature of data
in an archive. Looking at data is always useful!

The code used to prepare the video is on `GitHub`_.
Please don't tell the instrument PI we did this.
