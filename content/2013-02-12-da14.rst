On Friday 15 February, a 50-meter asteroid named `2012 DA14`_ will
approach Earth to within a distance of `just ~28 000 km`_. The internet
`is buzzing`_ about this near-miss because the object is expected to
become brighter than 9th magnitude for approximately 3 hours
(18h00-21h30 UTC), peaking at a brightness of 7th magnitude near 19h45
UTC. Although this is just below the brightness limit of the unaided
eye, it is within reach of good binoculars.

While there are `plenty`_ of `maps`_ online showing *where in the sky*
you may find 2012 DA14, I could not find any maps showing *where on
Earth* you have to be to get a good view. So I made a few maps myself.
Green areas in the animated gif below indicate parts of the world where
the asteroid will be above (and the Sun below) the horizon as it sweeps
past. The maps were generated using a Python class which I pushed to my
GitHub `repository`_.
