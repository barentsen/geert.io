To celebrate the completion of my PhD and start of a post-doc, I've
decided to start publishing bits and pieces of research on a blog. I'm
hoping this will encourage me to write about results more frequently,
hence achieving more scientific output and interaction than I would
obtain through peer-reviewed publications and conferences alone.

I am inspired by a number of existing research bloggers who I enjoy
reading. They include `Andrew Gelman`_, `David Hogg`_, `Sarah Kendrew`_,
`Andy Lawrence`_, `Adrian Price-Whelan`_, `Robert Simpson`_,
`AstroBetter`_, `Remanzacco`_, `Zooniverse Blogs`_, `Stuart Lowe`_, as
well as a a bunch of *micro-bloggers* on Twitter, and others who I
forget to list.

This blog has just two rules:

#. I shall not apologise for the frequency of posts, or lack thereof.
#. I shall not apologise for breaking the first rule.
