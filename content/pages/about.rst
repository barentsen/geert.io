:slug: about

Hi there! My name is **Geert**, which is a funny Dutch name.

I am an **Astronomer** and **Computer Scientist**
at the NASA Ames Research Center in sunny **Silicon Valley**, California.

I help run NASA's **Kepler/K2 Space Telescope**,
which is discovering **Earth-like planets orbiting other stars**
and has yielded a huge, revolutionary data set
that is aiding all areas of astrophysics.

I became an astronomer because I love to analyze data using powerful tools such as **Python**, **PostgreSQL**, and **high-performance computing**.
I believe that computers are a bicycle for the brain and I like to cycle them as far and as fast as I can. ðŸš´

I obtained my undergraduate degree in computer science
at the University of Antwerp in Belgium,
where I focused on **statistics**, **probability theory**, **databases**, and **machine learning**.

After my undergraduate studies,
I tackled data analysis challenges
during internships at 
the **Meteorological Institute of Belgium** and
the **European Space Agency**.

I then went on to obtain a **PhD in Astrophysics** on the top of star formation
at the Armagh Observatory (Queen's University Belfast) in Northern Ireland,
and completed **post-doctoral research** at the University of Hertfordshire, where I used large telescopes to map our Milky Way and gained **teaching experience** by lecturing undergraduate courses on software engineering and statistics.

In 2015, I was given the incredible opportunity to join **NASA**, where I work now.

.. NASA Astronomy Picture Of the Day
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    On April 25, 2011, my picture of star-forming region IC1396 was featured
    as NASA's `Astronomy Picture of the Day`_ and was also featured on the
    `The Guardian`_ and `ING`_ websites. I assembled the mosaic from 400
    individual images in three wavelength bands,
    obtained using the Wide Field Camera at the 2.5-meter
    `Isaac Newton Telescope`_ in La Palma. The data were taken over multiple
    nights between 2004 and 2009 as part of the `IPHAS survey`_. In `an
    accompanying paper`_, I analyzed this data and discovered more than 100
    previously unknown, young, solar-like stars which are still accreting
    material from a circumstellar disk.
