Hi there! üëã  My name is *Geert*, which is Dutch for *Gerard*.

I am a software engineer with a curiosity for science gone out of hand.
I have degrees in both Computer Science (MSc) and Physics (PhD)
and benefit from 10+ years experience in building open source
scientific software and analyzing data.
My experience includes diverse projects at three universities üë®‚Äçüéì,
two space agencies üöÄ, and one meteorological institute üå§.
My journey allowed me to work in five countries and three languages so far.

In recent years, I was part of the team that rescued NASA's award-winning
Kepler Space Telescope. I was privileged to experience first hand how a small
team of skilled engineers can achieve miracles when given the freedom to take
risks, prototype rapidly, and collaborate in a positive culture.
It enabled us to rescue the spacecraft and extend the mission by four years,
leading to the discovery of 300+ new planets across the galaxy.

.. NASA Astronomy Picture Of the Day
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    On April 25, 2011, my picture of star-forming region IC1396 was featured
    as NASA's `Astronomy Picture of the Day`_ and was also featured on the
    `The Guardian`_ and `ING`_ websites. I assembled the mosaic from 400
    individual images in three wavelength bands,
    obtained using the Wide Field Camera at the 2.5-meter
    `Isaac Newton Telescope`_ in La Palma. The data were taken over multiple
    nights between 2004 and 2009 as part of the `IPHAS survey`_. In `an
    accompanying paper`_, I analyzed this data and discovered more than 100
    previously unknown, young, solar-like stars which are still accreting
    material from a circumstellar disk.
