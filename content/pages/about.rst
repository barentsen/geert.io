:slug: about

Hi there! My name is Geert, which is a Dutch name without obvious pronounciation.

I am a `post-doctoral astronomer`_ at the University of Hertfordshire in the UK, where I work on the data processing and analysis of two projects
which aim to map our own Galaxy in unprecedented detail: `IPHAS`_ and `VPHAS`_.
I became an astronomer because I love analysing and visualising data using powerful tools like Python and PostgreSQL. I believe that computers are the bicycle of the brain, and I am trying to cycle as far and as fast as I can.

In my spare time, I act as a council member for the `International
Meteor Organization`_, for whiche I analyse data collected
by amateur astronomers. I have also
previously created a central archive of ground-based `amateur
observations of Venus`_ for the European Space Agency, and I enjoy
hunting for minor planets using remote telescopes.

Research interests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-  **Astronomical surveys**: `IPHAS`_, `VPHAS`_, LSST, ...
-  **Our solar system**: meteor showers, comets, minor
   planets.
-  **Computing**: probabilistic models, machine learning, data visualisation.

Things I have created
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-  numerous `scientific publications`_ in peer-reviewed journals;
-  `a detailed atlas of our own Galaxy`_ containing 219 million stars;
-  websites for the `IPHAS`_ and `VPHAS`_ astronomy surveys;
-  `meteoroid flux profiles`_ for the International Meteor Organization;
-  the `Venus ground-based image archive`_ for the European Space Agency;
-  NASA's `Astronomy Picture of the Day on 25 April 2011`_;
-  visualisations which made it `onto the BBC news website`_.

Other highlights
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-  My interviews with `BBC News`_, `Nature`_, `Sky At Night`_.
-  Asteroid 22275 is `named after me`_.
-  All-hailed on `episode 121`_ of the Recycled Electrons podcast.

.. NASA Astronomy Picture Of the Day
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    On April 25, 2011, my picture of star-forming region IC1396 was featured
    as NASA's `Astronomy Picture of the Day`_ and was also featured on the
    `The Guardian`_ and `ING`_ websites. I assembled the mosaic from 400
    individual images in three wavelength bands,
    obtained using the Wide Field Camera at the 2.5-meter
    `Isaac Newton Telescope`_ in La Palma. The data were taken over multiple
    nights between 2004 and 2009 as part of the `IPHAS survey`_. In `an
    accompanying paper`_, I analyzed this data and discovered more than 100
    previously unknown, young, solar-like stars which are still accreting
    material from a circumstellar disk.
