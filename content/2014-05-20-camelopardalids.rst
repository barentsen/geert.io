There *might* be an outburst of the `Camelopardalids meteor shower`_ on May 24th near 7h Universal Time (UT). If you live in North or Middle America, you will want to keep an eye on the sky in the night from Friday on Saturday for one or two hours surrounding 7h UT, which is 3am local time in New York, or midnight in San Francisco.

Green and yellow areas in the map below indicate the locations on Earth where the event will be visible from, if it happens.
