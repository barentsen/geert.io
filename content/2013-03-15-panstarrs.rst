Comet `C/2011 L4 (PANSTARRS)`_ has brightened dramatically over the past
week and is `now visible with the naked eye`_ from the Southern
Hemisphere. Pan-STARRS is moving north rapidly and will become visible
across Europe, North America and Asia **from Thursday 7 March onward**.
The comet is expected to reach its peak brightness around the time of
its closest approach to the Sun (called the perihelion) on Sunday 10
March. It may or may not lose brightness quickly afterwards, so you want
to catch this comet as soon as possible!

I plotted the visibility of Pan-STARRS in the `video`_ below.
Green/yellow areas in the animation indicate parts of the world where
the comet will be above the horizon (and the Sun at least six degrees
below the horizon). The movie shows that Pan-STARRS is only visible
shortly after sunset, when it is located `low above the Western
horizon`_.

The movie was created using my Python `visibility-maps module`_. The
original frames that went into making the movie `can be found here`_ and
may be used freely.
