As reported in my `previous post`_, the Draconids meteor shower showed
an exceptional peak on the evening of 8 October 2012 near 17h UT. The
peak was very pronounced in data from the `Canadian Meteor Orbit Radar`_
(CMOR), which reported rates `up to 2300 meteors/hour`_. In fact, I am
told that this radar system recorded more meteor orbits that day than on
any other day in its 13-year history.

While the peak was clearly exceptional in terms of radio observations,
it remains unclear how many meteors could be seen with the naked eye or
video cameras. The time of the peak mainly favoured sparsely populated
areas of our planet, and visual observations have so far only been
reported by amateur-astronomers \ *Alexandr Maidik* in Ukraine (`who
recorded 55 Draconids between 16h00-18h00 UT`_) and *Jakub Koukal* in
the Czech Republic (`who recorded 60 Draconids between 17h00-19h10
UT`_).

Using their data, I posted this graph of the Zenithal Hourly Rate (ZHR)
on the website of the `International Meteor Organization`_ (IMO):

While *Alexandr* and *Jakub* are both very experienced and reliable
observers, two visual reports are never enough to construct a reliable
activity profile. This is because different observing conditions
introduce different systematic uncertainties in the ZHR estimates, which
can only be corrected by averaging a large number of independent
observations.

Moreover, both observers suffered from either poor limiting magnitude or
evening twilight. The period covered by *Alexandr* alone yields rates up
to ZHR = 600 +/- 200 meteors per hour in the interval 16h50-17h00 UT.
However, as soon as data from *Jakub* is available from 17h00 UT, rates
drop to ZHR = 160 +/- 40. When leaving out the data from *Alexandr*,
*Jakub's* first interval (17h00-17h10 UT) yields ZHR = 104 +/- 39.

The latter estimate of ZHR ~100 meteors/hour seems broadly consistent
with data from the `IMO video network`_, which caught the end of the
peak and reported ZHRs in the range of 30 to 60 meteors per hour in the
interval 17h00-17h20. This is mainly based on two stations in Hungary,
operated by amateur-astronomers *Antal Igaz* and *Zsolt Perko*:

On the basis of this visual and video data, it seems tempting to
conclude that the outburst was dominated by small meteoroid particles
and hence produced only a moderate outburst in the optical (ZHR < 200
meteors per hour?), but more data is required to make such claim.

If anyone is aware of reports from Russia or China about this event,
please shout. This area of science crucially depends on data provided
by citizens.
