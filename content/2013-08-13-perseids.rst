The annual Perseids meteor shower peaked last night between 16h00m and 18h00m UT (12th August 2013). The peak ZHR was about 147 Â± 17 meteors/hour.

The graphs below show the visual activity graphs, which I have been generating for the `International Meteor Organization`_ during `each major meteor shower since 2006`_. The graphs are based on the naked-eye observing reports received from hundreds of citizen scientists around the world.
