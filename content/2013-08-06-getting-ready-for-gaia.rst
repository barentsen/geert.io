Gaia is one of the most ambitious space missions of the decade. Twitter has a lot of talk about it this morning, after `one pundit`_ started using the hashtag `#NRFG`_ - "Not Ready For Gaia".

I thought I would contribute to the debate by introducing a few friends who are #RFG. First of all, lets remind ourselves that one does not simply prepare:

... and when people tried it in the past, they got into trouble:

... some people are optimistic:

... but there is only one clear winner:
