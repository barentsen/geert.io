meteor shower will remain elusive for another while...

On 11 June 1930, three meteor observers in Maryland (USA) `witnessed a
flurry of shooting stars`_ originating from the constellation of
Delphinus. The mysterious meteor shower, called the gamma-Delphinids,
lasted less than 30 minutes. The shower had never been seen before, and
it has never returned since... until this year?

The gamma-Delphinids are one of `a dozen rare meteor showers`_ for which
only anecdotal evidence exists. Such showers are thought to be caused by
the dust trails of unknown **long-period comets**.

Meteoroid streams from long-period comets are thought to be very narrow.
In fact the dust trails are so compact that our planet only encounters
them when the gravitational pull from Jupiter and Saturn steers the
stream exactly into Earth's path. In contrast, famous meteor showers
such as the Perseids and the Leonids originate from known *short-period
comets*. Such streams are more widely dispersed due to their frequent
exposure to planetary perturbations and solar radiation in the Solar
System, and hence Earth encounters those short-period streams every
year.

On 11 June 2013 near 8:30 UT, Earth `is predicted`_ to encounter the
gamma-Delphinids for the first time since 1930. By measuring the time of
the outburst, or its absence, we'll be able to establish whether the
shower is real, and learn about its origin. This is important because it
teaches us about a large, Earth-crossing comet which we haven't
discovered yet.

Observers in North and South America are best placed to observe the
event. Green and yellow areas in the map below indicate parts of the
world where the sky will be dark, and the radiant above the horizon,
near the predicted time of the meteor shower.
