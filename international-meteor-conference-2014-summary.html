  <div>
    <p>I had the pleasure to take part in the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.imo.net/imc2014">International Meteor Conference</a> this weekend,
which is an annual meeting organised by the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.imo.net">International Meteor Organisation</a> (for which I am a council member).
The IMO is an international non-profit organisation
which exists to encourage international cooperation
between amateur astronomers in the field of meteor science.
Topics discussed include the observation of meteor showers using
various methods, the modeling of the parent meteoroid streams,
and the study of the occasional meteorite-dropping fireball events.</p>
<p>The study of these phenomena is limited
to a large degree by our ability
to monitor Earth's atmosphere across the globe in
a continuous fashion.
The field only counts about 100 full-time professionals
worldwide,
and hence amateur astronomers play a critical role
in contributing and analysing the much-needed data.
Out of the 130 participants that attend the meeting,
roughly 10% are professional and 90% are amateur.
Many of the amateurs carry out their work
at a professional level, but are called <em>amateurs</em>
simply because they are not being paid to do so.</p>
<div class="section" id="summarising-the-conference">
<h2>Summarising the conference</h2>
<p>I have been attending the conference for ten years now,
and in fact helped to organise it twice
(in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imo.net/imc2005/">2005</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imo.net/imc2010/">2010</a>).
These meetings are important to me because they allowed me to gain
experience in presenting and publishing scientific results
when I was still an undergraduate student,
and hence played an important role in enabling me to become an astronomer.
They are also great fun because the participants
actually <em>love</em> the subject (&quot;amator&quot; means &quot;lover&quot; after all).
This implies that the participants tend to be driven entirely by curiosity,
rather than the publication or funding pressure which makes
so many professional academics behave in absurd ways
(as per Darwin's theory of natural selection).</p>
<p>This year I was invited to present a <em>conference summary</em>
as the last talk of the meeting.
This means that,
when all the sensible people went to bed
on the last evening of the conference,
I grabbed my laptop and summarised the meeting's
41 talks and 17 posters
(which are all <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imo.net/imc2014/program.php">available on the conference website</a>).
I decided to approach this challenge by selecting one
<em>key slide</em> from each of the speakers,
and combining them into a coherent story.</p>
<p>The slides of my 20-minute summary are shown here
(you can also <a class="reference external" href="https://speakerd.s3.amazonaws.com/presentations/8f68afb024ca01326e49064769dcc1c7/repaired.pdf">download the PDF</a>):</p>
<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-slide="1" data-id="8f68afb024ca01326e49064769dcc1c7" data-ratio="1.33333333333333" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script><p>Of course the slides do not include the various comments I made,
or the inevitable jokes,
but they do offer a feeling for the contents of the meeting.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-orbit-data-revolution">
<h2>The orbit data revolution</h2>
<p>The first thing I pointed out during the summary is that
we are seeing a spectacular increase in the number of automated
camera networks that operate to detect meteors.
For example, during the meeting we learned that such networks
are now extending beyond Europe, USA, Japan
into e.g. Brazil and Morocco,
thereby increasing our global view on the meteor activity.
This is important because many meteor showers
harbour young, compact dust trails that produce
intense but short-lived outbursts,
which last no longer than about 30 minutes.
Such outbursts can only ever be observed
from selected regions on Earth where both
the geometry and the weather are right,
and hence a global view is needed to
record all the outbursts in a systematic way
and ultimately chart the detailed structure of
all the meteoroid streams.</p>
<p>As well as recording more meteors,
improvements in the data analysis software
have led to a dramatic increase in the number of
meteoroid orbits that are computed from
those meteors (if observed simultaneously from multiple angles).
I created the graph below,
which shows the number of meteoroid orbits
offered by the three most popular data sets that are <em>publicly available</em>:
the <a class="reference external" href="http://sonotaco.jp/doc/SNM/">SonotaCo Database</a> (Japanese amateurs),
the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.daa.fmph.uniba.sk/edmond">EDMOND Database</a> (European amateurs),
and the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.astro.sk/IAUMDC/Ph2013/">IAU Photographic Database</a> (professionals).
The graph illustrates that the number of observed meteoroid orbits
has increased by nearly two orders of magnitude in just a couple of years.</p>
<div class="figure">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://www.geert.io/images/2014-meteoroid-orbit-databases.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.geert.io/images/2014-meteoroid-orbit-databases.png" /></a>
<p class="caption">Cumulative number of meteoroid orbits available in three popular
public data sets. The number of orbits has increased from
about 4,000 in 2006 to more than 250,000 in 2013.
(Note that additional public data sets by amateurs exist,
e.g. the <a class="reference external" href="http://cmn.rgn.hr/downloads/downloads.html">Croatian Meteor Network catalogues</a>.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-are-meteors-being-recorded">
<h2>Why are meteors being recorded?</h2>
<p>There are several good scientific reasons to obtain large
statistical samples of meteors.
These reasons include:
(i) identifying new meteoroid streams,
(ii) confirming the parameters of existing ones,
(iii) testing dynamical models of their evolution,
and (iv) computing the particle fluxes and mass distributions.
Space agencies are particularly interested in the latter aspect,
because meteoroids present an important hazard for spacecraft.
The data are also of interest to the general public, indirectly,
because they help predict when beautiful meteor shower displays
will appear in the sky.</p>
<p>During my summary I reminded the audience that some of these
science cases are better addressed using a small number
of <em>very accurate</em> orbits,
rather than the current large sets of somewhat noisy orbits.
I drew a parallel between asteroid science,
where the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_family">study of asteroid dynamics</a> revolves largely around
the famous <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_family#mediaviewer/File:AsteroidIncAu.png">inclination vs semi-major axis diagram</a>,
which reveals several asteroid families and the
gravitational resonances that affect them.
Models suggest that similar patterns exist
in the population of meteoroids,
but the accuracy of the observed orbits have so far proven
insufficient to reveal such patterns in a routine way
(see <a class="reference external" href="https://speakerdeck.com/barentsen/meteor-astrometry-what-accuracy-do-we-need">my previous talk on this topic</a>).</p>
<p>Fortunately, several talks at the conference
discussed ways in which the accuracy of the data can be improved.
For example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.imo.net/imc2014/imc2014-Bettonvil-Chipolata.pdf">Felix Bettonvil</a> (Utrecht) and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imo.net/imc2014/imc2014-egal.pdf">Auriane Egal</a> (Paris) showed that a high-frequency electronic shutter can enable the accuracy of meteor velocities to be improved significantly, which in turn leads to better estimates for the semi-major axis (ie. the size of the orbit);</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.imo.net/imc2014/imc2014_colas.pdf">Francois Colas</a> (Paris) plans to include doppler shifts observed at radio frequencies to refine orbits determined from optical data;</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.imo.net/imc2014/imc2014-gural.pdf">Pete Gural</a> (Washington) reminded us that we would benefit from meteor surveys that exploit small telescopes rather than wide-angle camera lenses. In fact it is surprising that no such surveys seem to exist at present.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="visual-data-remains-important">
<h2>Visual data remains important</h2>
<p>Although much of the recent increase in meteor data is
brought about by sensitive video cameras,
several speakers reminded us of the importance of visual (ie. human eye)
and radio observations. Visual observations, in particular,
remain the best method for estimating the fluxes of large meteoroids.
This is because (i) video cameras do not nearly offer the same
sensitivity and field of view as the human eye,
and (ii) visual observations are well-understood and calibrated.
Likewise, radio observations remain necessary to constrain the
flux of smaller meteoroids.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-need-for-open-data">
<h2>The need for open data</h2>
<p>I ended my summary with a rant on the importance
of public data sets and open software.
I believe that everyone in the field would benefit from having more
groups share their data, for three key reasons:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>open data sets raise the profile of meteor science as a necessary branch of astrophysics -- the availability of high-quality databases may attract more researchers and resources into the field;</li>
<li>there is ample evidence in other branches of astronomy that authors of open data sets receive more citations and the recognition of funding panels, because their openness allow other researchers to make serendipitous discoveries;</li>
<li>last but not least, science needs to be reproducible!</li>
</ol>
<p>During my rant I observed that, at present,
many amateur meteor scientists share the data despite
using their private money,
whereas most professionals use public money yet keep the data private.
A number of participants told me afterwards that this situation
is quite shocking, really, and I share that feeling.
I imagine that many professionals believe that keeping data private gives
them an advantage over competing scientists,
but what it really does -- in my humble opinion --
is that it makes the entire field of meteor science look
like an outdated branch of astronomy
that does not require researchers to analyse large contemporary data sets.
Put differently, I asserted that the entire field is likely losing out
on funding and scientific progress <em>to other fields</em>,
because professional data sets aren't being shared.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-need-for-open-software">
<h2>The need for open software</h2>
<p>I then went on to make similar observations about the habit
of meteor scientists to keep their software closed.
It seems rather obvious that open, re-usable software components
can revolutionise the efficiency and accuracy of our observing projects.
I pointed out that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>as an author of open source software, you are free to choose your own license, eg. you can demand citations or require co-authorship if that is what you are worried about;</li>
<li>authors of open source software do not <em>have</em> to offer support, it is perfectly fine to put source code on line with a disclaimer that you do not have the time to implement new features or fix bugs;</li>
<li>we <em>all</em> have dirty code, so stop worrying about the quality -- if a piece of software is good enough to produce your scientific results, then by definition it is also good enough to share;</li>
<li>papers on data analysis methods can never capture all the details, whereas source code can.</li>
</ul>
<p>I then went on to explain how other branches of astrophysics are being made
a lot easier by the existence of open source libraries such as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.astropy.org">AstroPy</a>,
which counts nearly 100 contributors and exploits modern tools
such as <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>
to enable such mass collaboration. I asserted that we would all
benefit from having a similar, more vibrant, meteor software community.</p>
<p>Although it is unlikely that many meteor workers will make a sudden shift
towards open data and software,
I do think that my brief and friendly rant
may have inspired some. Let's wait and see!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="next-year">
<h2>Next year</h2>
<p>We are very grateful to the <a class="reference external" href="http://ceres.geol.u-psud.fr/fripon/">FRIPON group</a> for hosting
this year's fabulous meeting.
Next year's International Meteor Conference will take place in Austria
on 27-30 August 2015. I can warmly recommend all those interested in meteors,
at all levels, to join the fun!</p>
