    <p>The internet <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RussianMeteor">is buzzing</a> about a fireball which caused a powerful
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_boom">sonic boom</a> over Chelyabinsk in&nbsp;Russia,&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21468116">injuring hundreds</a>. A
question asked by many is: <em>how common is such event</em>?</p>
<p>Answer: more common than you might think!</p>
<p>The population of Solar System bodies which cross Earth's orbit range
from mm-sized dust (producing meteors) to km-sized asteroids (producing
mass extinctions). The frequency of such objects is constrained by
meteor observations on one hand (there are ~1000 visible meteors per
second across the planet), and asteroid surveys on the other hand (a
10km body will hit us every ~100 million years).</p>
<p>The object that struck Russia falls somewhere in the middle of this
range. We know that a meteoroid needs to be larger than 1 meter in
diameter to penetrate deep enough into the atmosphere to cause a
significant airburst (though velocity, entry angle and composition are
important too). At the same time, the scale of destruction is a lot
smaller than the famous <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event">Tunguska event in 1908</a>, which is thought to
have been caused by a 50m-sized body. Hence a first guess for the size
of the Russian meteoroid would be &quot;between 1 and 20 meter&quot;.</p>
<p>We don't know the frequency of asteroids in this size range very well.
There are not enough meteor observing cameras to detect these rare
events, yet the objects are too small and faint to be detected by
telescopes ahead of their impact (apart from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v458/n7237/full/nature07920.html">one notable exception</a> in
2008).</p>
<p>There is an industry that is very successful in detecting these impacts
however; military space surveillance. The US Defense and Energy
departments operate satellites to detect the heat signatures from
nuclear weapons and rocket launches from space. In 2002, a team led by
Professor&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://meteor.uwo.ca/~pbrown/">Peter Brown</a> obtained access to classified data on 300
large fireballs detected between 1994 and 2002 by the military. The
authors combined this information with ground-based observations to
estimate the relationship between the size of meteoroids and their
impact frequency:</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">The relationship between the size of meteoroids and their impact frequency. Credit: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v420/n6913/full/nature01238.html">Brown et al. 2002</a> (Figure 4).</p>
</div>
<p>The work by Brown et al. may approximately be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a 10cm-body hits us every few minutes;</li>
<li>a 1m-body every few months;</li>
<li>a 10m-body every few years to decades;</li>
<li>a 100m-body every few millenia.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, a fireball like the one in Russia is likely to occur somewhere
between every few years and every few decades, but the uncertainty is
large. Shifting the trend slightly upwards or downwards can change the
estimated frequencies by a factor of several, and so we should be
careful to pin down any numbers with large confidence.</p>
<p>Whilst the Russian meteor appears to be the largest <em>recorded</em> event for
a century, it would be imprudent to infer that it hence only occurs once
a century. It is difficult to rely on historical records of the past,
because less than 20% of the surface of our planet is inhabited, and so
many impacts might have gone unnoticed. In fact there is some evidence
for a possible <a class="reference external" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995Obs...115..250B">'Brazilian Tunguska' on 13 August 1930</a> and a <a class="reference external" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995JIMO...23..207S">'Guyana
Tunguska' on 11 December 1935</a>, but events like these may have been
undocumented or forgotten.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are reasons to believe that the impact frequencies are
not constant, but may be elevated during certain periods (see <a class="reference external" href="http://star.herts.ac.uk/~gb/pub/2012_imc.pdf">my recent
talk</a> on this topic). Unfortunately, the US military announced in 2009
that they <a class="reference external" href="http://www.space.com/6829-military-hush-incoming-space-rocks-classified.html">will no longer share fireball observations with scientists</a>,
so we'll have to come up with other ways to pin down the exact danger
coming from small asteroids!</p>
